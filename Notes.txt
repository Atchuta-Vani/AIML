## üß† Agent Design for TravelPlanner

Here are a few **useful agent roles** you can build into your app:

---

### üó∫Ô∏è 1. **LocationSearchAgent**

**Goal:** Given a location and date range, search for interesting places, events, or attractions.

* **Inputs:** Location, start date, end date, user preferences (optional)
* **Tools:** WebSearchTool, Event API (like Eventbrite, Google Events)
* **Behavior:** Uses LLM + search tools to compile a list of:

  * Attractions (museums, parks, landmarks)
  * Events (festivals, concerts)
  * Weather-aware activities
* **Output:** List of `AttractionItem` or `EventItem` objects

---

### üóìÔ∏è 2. **ItineraryPlannerAgent**

**Goal:** Convert attractions/events into a daily travel plan.

* **Inputs:** List of attractions/events, location, number of days
* **Tools:** Optional ‚Äì calendar APIs
* **Behavior:**

  * Groups attractions by proximity
  * Balances busy and light days
  * Adds breaks/meals if needed
* **Output:** `ItineraryPlan` with daily plans, maps, and timing

---

### üíµ 3. **BudgetAdvisorAgent**

**Goal:** Provide a budget estimate and cost breakdown for the trip.

* **Inputs:** Selected itinerary, location, travel preferences
* **Tools:** Currency converter, flight/hotel APIs, OpenAI function tool
* **Output:** `TripBudgetReport` with estimated costs: transport, food, lodging, tickets

---

### üì© 4. **EmailAgent** (or `ItineraryEmailAgent`)

**Goal:** Send the finalized itinerary or trip summary via email.

* **Tools:** `@function_tool` that writes to email or PDF
* **Output:** Confirmation or link to the report

### ‚ú® Bonus Ideas

You could also add:

| Agent Name              | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **WeatherCheckerAgent** | Warns about weather that could affect travel        |
| **TravelDocAgent**      | Checks for visa, vaccine, or document needs         |
| **BookingAgent**        | Suggests or books flights/hotels (future expansion) |

---

## üì¶ Output Types

You can define structured outputs like:

```python
class AttractionItem:
    name: str
    type: str
    description: str
    url: str
    estimated_time: str

class ItineraryPlan:
    days: List[Dict[str, List[AttractionItem]]]

class TripBudgetReport:
    total_cost: float
    breakdown: Dict[str, float]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Workflow (Agent Pipeline)

1. **User input**: "Plan a 5-day trip to Paris in October"
2. **Planner agent** decides to:

   * Ask `LocationSearchAgent` for attractions
   * Call `ItineraryPlannerAgent` to schedule them
   * Ask `BudgetAdvisorAgent` to estimate costs
   * Use `EmailAgent` to send the result

---

## üß† Tools You Might Use

* `WebSearchTool` ‚Äì to find events/places
* `function_tool` ‚Äì for local tools like PDF writing, maps, APIs
* `ModelSettings(tool_choice="required")` ‚Äì to ensure agents always use tools when needed

---

Next Step:

Write Python class for any of these agents using OpenAI's Agent SDK.
